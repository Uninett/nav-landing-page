The initial 4.4 series release of NAV is now out.

The source code is available for download at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/nav/4.4/4.4.0). New packages for Debian Wheezy and Jessie is published in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian) as usual.

The virtual appliance will be updated shortly.

### Changes

NAV 4.4 now requires Django 1.7. Unfortunately, Django 1.7 was obsoleted in December, but since we mainly target Debian stable (Jessie), security fixes will be backported by Debian to Django 1.7 for a long time to come. (If you are still running Debian Wheezy, you can obtain python-django 1.7 from the official wheezy-backports repository).

NAV 4.4 introduces the following user-visible features and improvements:
