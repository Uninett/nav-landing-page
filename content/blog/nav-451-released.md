The first maintenance release of the NAV 4.5 series is now out.

The source code is available for download at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/nav/4.5/4.5.1). A new package Debian Jessie has been published in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian) as usual (and the virtual appliance is being updated).

## Changes

The following reported bugs have been fixed:

*   [LP#1591973](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav/+bug/1591973/) (navstats binary is not installed in NAV 4.5.0)
*   [LP#1592281](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav/+bug/1592281/) (ipdevpoll statuscheck errors out on some Aruba switches)
*   [LP#1593193](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nav/+bug/1593193/) (Race condition may make eventengine ignore events at random)

Happy NAVing everyone!
