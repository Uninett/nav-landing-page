The fifth maintenance release of the 4.8 series of NAV is now out!

The source code is available for download at [GitHub](https://github.com/UNINETT/nav/releases). New packages for Debian 8/9 (Jessie/Stretch) are published in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian), as usual.

The virtual appliance will be updated shortly.

### Copyright changes

Third party copyright owners of NAV code, like The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and the University of Troms√∏, have signed over their copyright for their code contributions to Uninett. NAV 4.8 is still licensed under GPLv2-only, but will be relicensed under GPLv3 in the upcoming 4.9 series. This should have no impact on end users; as a company with public ownership, Uninett will always strive to keep NAV under a free and open source license.

Happy NAVing everyone!
