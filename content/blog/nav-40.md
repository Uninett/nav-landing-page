For those of you who have not already noticed, we released [the final NAV 4.0 version](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa/arc/nav-users/2014-03/msg00036.html) less than two weeks ago. Due to a serious bug found on the 3.15 branch, [4.0.1 was also released last week](https://launchpad.net/nav/4.0/4.0.1).

We also celebrated with cake!

As before, the most convenient way of getting started with NAV is using Debian GNU/Linux and the packages from our APT repository. If you aren’t already up and running with NAV, see our [guide for adding the repository to your Debian server](https://nav.uninett.no/nav_on_debian).

We realize that [Graphite’s documentation may not be the best](http://graphite.wikidot.com/), and we are already receiving question about installing and configuring both the Carbon backend and the web frontend. Since we are a bit Debian focused, we have published [a guide for installing and configuring Graphite for NAV use on a Debian server](https://nav.uninett.no/graphite_on_debian) on our wiki.

As always, happy NAVing!
