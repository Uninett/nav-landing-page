The second maintenance release of the NAV 4.5 series is now out.

The source code is available for download at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/nav/4.5/4.5.2). A new package Debian Jessie has been published in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian) as usual (and the virtual appliance is being updated).
