The sixth maintenance release of the 5.0 series of NAV is now out!

The source code is available for download at [GitHub](https://github.com/UNINETT/nav/releases).

New packages for Debian 9/10 (Stretch/Buster) are available in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian) as usual.

Please also be extra aware of config file changes. Look out for `*.dpkg-dist` files in `/etc/nav` and make sure to update your running config.

The virtual appliance will be updated shortly.

#### Deprecation warning

Python 2 reached its end-of-life on **January 1, 2020**. NAV 5.0 therefore moves to Python 3, and as such, you will need at least Python 3.5 to run NAV.

Most of NAV will still run on Python 2 as of the 5.0 release, but from this point, Python 2 will be deprecated and we will start removing code that exists solely to keep compatibility with Python 2.
