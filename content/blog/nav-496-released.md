The sixth maintenance release of the 4.9 series of NAV is now out!

The source code is available for download at [GitHub](https://github.com/UNINETT/nav/releases).

New packages for Debian 8/9 (Jessie/Stretch) are available in our [APT repository](https://nav.uninett.no/install-instructions/#debian) as usual.

The Debian packages for NAV 4.9 have been rebuilt using dh-virtualenv, which means that most of the Python dependencies are now embedded into the packages themselves. If you have previously added a priority apt pin for packages from apt.uninett.no, you may now remove it, as there are no longer any other packages needed from that repository to run NAV.

Please also be extra aware of config file changes. Look out for `*.dpkg-dist` files in `/etc/nav` and make sure to update your running config.

The virtual appliance has also been updated.
